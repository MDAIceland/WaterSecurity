Argentina, which was temporarily unclassified in July 2016 pending release of revised national accounts statistics, is classified as upper middle income for FY17 as of September 29, 2016.

The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. An alternative conversion factor is used when the official exchange rate is judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin from the rate effectively applied to domestic transactions of foreign currencies and traded products. In the case of Argentina, the World Bank has found that during 2012-2015 there were two exchange rates (official and parallel) and parallel exchange rate (blue chip swap rate) was used in around 20% of the transactions.

In principle the approach could use other data like the labor statistics which automatically include all services. A basic concept of the algorithm is the importance of diversification. This is correct at the level of countries but it becomes gradually problematic if one moves to smaller scales like regions, cities up to individual firms where specialization becomes dominant. In these cases suitable modifications should be considered.  The COMTRADE dataset comes at different levels of granularity. Each level has advantages and disadvantages which should be considered in relation to the problem addressed.","The new literature of Economic Fitness uses techniques which, differently from traditional index construction approaches, do not try to average out the complexity of the system, but embraces it by explicitly building on the heterogeneity of individual actors, activities and interactions to extract relevant parameters to characterize the system.  In this way, information about production capabilities may be extracted from trade in goods.  The interaction among products traded, and the relatively unique combinations are a precursor to future competitiveness and long-term growth.   A basic characteristic of Economic Fitness is being parameter free. The standard methods of analysis consider many elements and sum them up in some suitable way. This sum of incommensurate elements leads to a major problem of controlling noise while increasing signal. The Fitness approach starts by considering a single dataset to control noise problems.  Other data can then be added later in a controlled hierarchical framework 9e.g, services, technologies). The algorithm is designed on simple and transparent economical concepts which have a clear meaning and have been extensively tested. The evolution of each country is defined in the GDP-Fitness space which shows a strong heterogeneity in the dynamics. There is zone characterized by regular flow and another one which is more chaotic. This implies that growth forecasting should consider this heterogeneity and go beyond standard regressions. This novel approach to the analysis and long-term forecasting has been shown to outperform the standard methods even if it requires much less data."
