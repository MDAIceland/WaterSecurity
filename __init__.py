## Water Security - Iceland
The current climate change scenario predicts that almost half of the worldâ€™s population will live in areas of high water stress by 2050 with limited access to fresh clean water. Governments, national, and international institutions, as well as water management companies, are looking for solutions that can address this growing global water demand. Cities are encouraged to take action on water security, to build resilience to water scarcity and manage this finite resource for the future.

This project aims to look at and predict the water securiy around the world. It contains a preprocessing, a model, an a web-application.

#### In order to get the final dataset from the preprocessing the following notebooks have to be executed in the given order: 
1. prep_hdro_v2.ipynb
2. combine_unlabeled.ipynb
3. Merge Unlabeled to Labeled.ipynb
4. CitiesPopulationDensity.ipynb
