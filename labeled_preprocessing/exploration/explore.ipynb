The NSW Government Flood Prone Land Policy assists in determining if development on floodplains is appropriate and sustainable.  The Floodplain Development Manual, developed by the NSW Government requires preparation of a Flood Study and a Floodplain Risk Management Study and development and implementation of a Floodplain Risk Management Plan.The City of Sydney local government area comprises eight drainage catchment areas in; Alexandra Canal, Blackwattle Bay, Centennial Park, City area, Darling Harbour, Johnstonâ€™s Creek, Rushcutters Bay and Woolloomooloo.The City has committed $1.8 million to city-wide Floodplain Risk Management Studies, which includes $600,000 in NSW and Federal Government grants. We have allocated $57 million for Green Square essential infrastructure drainage improvements, and $59 million over the next 10 years for drainage capacity works across Sydney.As part of our floodplain management approach, the City is undertaking the first ever city-wide look at the drainage issues and flood risks that exist in Sydney.  The work being undertaken includes a series of surveys of catchment areas.  These surveys will help us understand where drainage and mitigation works are required to ensure water flow and drainage is properly managed across the local government area.  This will dramatically reduce flood risk and safeguard local homes and businesses. The first Management Plan to be approved by Council is the Green Square West Kensington (GSWK) Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan. This catchment is one of the lowest lying areas of our city, and subject to water ponding and flooding. The GSWK Plan proposes the creation of a large underground drainage culvert running 2.3 kilometres through the Green Square town centre from Link Road in Zetland to the Alexandra Canal. The culvert will drain floodwaters away from homes, businesses and roads in and around Joynton Avenue, Lachlan Street, South Dowling Street and Botany Road.', 'Since 2006, the number of parks and open spaces requiring irrigation in the Local Government Area has increased by 52 per cent.

These include staff training, new technologies and improvements to reporting.  The City has replaced the existing irrigation systems at Waterloo Oval, Edmund Resche Reserve and Pirrama Park. These upgrades will improve water efficiency and reliability of systems, and reduce the need for frequent maintenance often required by aging systems. Improvements to the data capture, via Cloudmaster, and record keeping are establishing a more reliable data set in which to evaluate and establish real water targets for high water use parks.

Following the substantial completion of the R&R Programme, the condition of the water distribution network has been largely improved.

       "       list(['In NSW, local councils are responsible for managing flooding. The NSW Government Flood Prone Land Policy assists in determining if development on floodplains is appropriate and sustainable.  The Floodplain Development Manual, developed by the NSW Government requires preparation of a Flood Study and a Floodplain Risk Management Study and development and implementation of a Floodplain Risk Management Plan.The City of Sydney local government area comprises eight drainage catchment areas in; Alexandra Canal, Blackwattle Bay, Centennial Park, City area, Darling Harbour, Johnstonâ€™s Creek, Rushcutters Bay and Woolloomooloo.The City has committed $1.8 million to city-wide Floodplain Risk Management Studies, which includes $600,000 in NSW and Federal Government grants. We have allocated $57 million for Green Square essential infrastructure drainage improvements, and $59 million over the next 10 years for drainage capacity works across Sydney.As part of our floodplain management approach, the City is undertaking the first ever city-wide look at the drainage issues and flood risks that exist in Sydney.  The work being undertaken includes a series of surveys of catchment areas.  These surveys will help us understand where drainage and mitigation works are required to ensure water flow and drainage is properly managed across the local government area.  This will dramatically reduce flood risk and safeguard local homes and businesses. The first Management Plan to be approved by Council is the Green Square West Kensington (GSWK) Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan. This catchment is one of the lowest lying areas of our city, and subject to water ponding and flooding. The GSWK Plan proposes the creation of a large underground drainage culvert running 2.3 kilometres through the Green Square town centre from Link Road in Zetland to the Alexandra Canal. The culvert will drain floodwaters away from homes, businesses and roads in and around Joynton Avenue, Lachlan Street, South Dowling Street and Botany Road.', 'Since 2006, the number of parks and open spaces requiring irrigation in the Local Government Area has increased by 52 per cent. These include Wentworth Park, Redfern Park, Redfern Oval, Pirrama Park, Harmony Park, Prince Alfred Park, Paddington Reservoir Gardens, Peace Park, Lillian Fowler Reserve and Coulson Street Reserve.Council has met its 2016 target for water usage in City parks of 180L per square metre of irrigated space. City parks and open spaces are currently trending at 171L per square meter of irrigated space. The 2012 Parks Water Saving Action Plan outlines nine action items that will contribute to achieving the Cityâ€™s sustainable water targets. These include staff training, new technologies and improvements to reporting.  The City has replaced the existing irrigation systems at Waterloo Oval, Edmund Resche Reserve and Pirrama Park. These upgrades will improve water efficiency and reliability of systems, and reduce the need for frequent maintenance often required by aging systems. Improvements to the data capture, via Cloudmaster, and record keeping are establishing a more reliable data set in which to evaluate and establish real water targets for high water use parks. On-going training and specifications that establish the Cityâ€™s targets are providing greater efficiency in water use. As new technologies and systems become available, the City will explore each option for future alternate water supply.']),\n",
       "       list(['Rehabilitation and Replacement (R&R) ProgrammeA programme of Rehabilitation and Replacement (R&R) of water mains was launched in 2000 to replace and rehabilitate around 3 000 km of the aged water mains in Hong Kong. The R&R Programme was substantially completed in 2015. At present, the total length of water mains in Hong Kong is about 8 000 km.   Following the substantial completion of the R&R Programme, the condition of the water distribution network has been largely improved. The annual number of water main bursts has been reduced from the peak of about 2 500 in 2000 to 88 in 2017. The leakage rate has also been reduced from exceeding 25% in 2000 to about 15.2% in 2017. The water network would be managed under risk based asset management.Water Intelligent Network (WIN)Notwithstanding the completion of the R&R Programme, the water mains previously not covered in the R&R Programme will continue to age and deteriorate. Riding on the technological advancement of sensors, telemetry, network management software and data analysis in recent years, we consider it an opportune time to implement the Water Intelligent Network (WIN) to maintain the healthiness of the water distribution network. The essence of WIN is continuous monitoring of network performance in a holistic manner by utilising advanced technologies. Implementation of WIN enables the effective execution of measures under the four pillars of network management in an integrated and coordinated manner. These four pillars include (a) active leakage detection and control through the usage of the monitoring and sensing equipment installed in the network; (b) pressure management to reduce the pressure in the network of the PMAs; (c) quality and speedy repairs to water main leaks and bursts; and (d) asset management by reprovisioning of aged water mains which are beyond economic repair. WIN also enables detection of probable unauthorised consumption from the network.']),\n",
