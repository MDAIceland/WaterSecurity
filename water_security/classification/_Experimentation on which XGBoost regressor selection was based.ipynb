    "The procedure consists in fitting small trees to the residuals in order to slowly improve the prediction error. Generally, model that learn slowly tend to perform better. A pitfall of Boosting, however, is that it relies very much on its tuning parameters. Hence, it's important to undergo `Cross Validation` in order to select the combination returning the highest accuracy, for every target. \n",
