There will there be an additional resource need for drinking water in general for the Barcelona Metropolitan Area of 34 hm3/year and for Barcelona city this is estimated at 18hm3/year.It is worth noting that water production from desalination in 2050 is considered equal to current production (2012), although the plant has a capacity of up to 60 hm3/year. The reason is that in the context of climate change, in which Barcelona needs to increase its adaptability and resilience, the idea of covering the missing water with desalination (which could more than cover it) has been ruled out due to its high electricity consumption, which means increased CO2 emissions.

Erosion-control problems can be found in at least 13 of the 17 reservations that make up the park system. At the same time, Greater Cleveland's earliest sewers (primarily within the city and its inner-ring suburbs) are combined sewers. Built around the turn of the 19th century, these sewers carry sewage, industrial waste, and stormwater in a single pipe.

The spatial and temporal variability of temperature, evaporation and rainfall largely determine the level of urban water supply security (i.e. reliability). Future climate scenarios are fundamental to the level of the ACTâ€™s future water security. This was evident when South-eastern Australia experienced 7 years of severe drought between 2002 and 2009. The duration and impacts of this ""Millennium Drought"" were unprecedented in the ACTâ€™s historical climatic record since Federation. For one year in 2006 stream flows reduced to 90% but averaged around 60%, and water storages fell to low levels (approximately 30% of capacity), and severe water restrictions (Stage 3) were imposed for almost 4.5 years across the period 2003 to 2010. Stage 4 restrictions which require no outside watering were nearly enacted, however a storm in 2007 averted this stage. Additionally, the light soaking autumn rainfall has decreased significantly, with an almost 40% reduction observed over the period 1997 to 2010 as compared to the long term average. Over the same period, spring and summer rainfalls have increased however these are delivered as intense and localised storms. This change continued through the 2010/2011 wet years. Considering the lessons from the Millennium Drought and the changing seasonality of rainfall, there are expected to remain long-term water related risks as a result of increasing population growth combined with periods of reduced rainfall. If climate emerges drier than projected it will further compromise the ACTâ€™s water supply security. The likelihood to this scenario happening is â€˜Possibleâ€™ and would lead to â€˜Majorâ€™ to â€˜Severeâ€™ consequences, such as the water supply system not able to meet the ACTâ€™s unrestricted demand for water.",415000,2017,"(-35.3075, 149.124)"

Through the Cityâ€™s Water Conservation Plan, which outlined measures to achieve targeted water reductions at City facilities, the City was able to reduce its water use by 35%.In 2017, the Governor lifted the drought emergency for most of the state and asked Californians to continue using water responsibly and to make conservation a way of life.

However, at certain times of the year the potential for contamination during wet-weather flow conditions exists due to the proximity of the North Shore Channel. In addition, the proximity to a major shipping lane adds to the susceptibility of these three intakes. Lake Michigan, as well as all the great lakes, has many different organizations and associations that are currently working to either maintain or improve water quality.

En el curso de ambos rÃ­os existen sistemas de embalses que, ademÃ¡s de posibilitar la producciÃ³n de hidroelectricidad, actÃºan como elementos de regulaciÃ³n de caudales. En el rÃ­o Diamante, cuyo mÃ³dulo es de 36.8 m3/s, se encuentra el sistema conformado por los diques:-Agua de Toro (376 hm3), Los Reyunos (255hm3) y El Tigre (7 hm3) En el rÃ­o Atuel, de mÃ³dulo 34,7 m3/s, los diques:-El Nihuil (356 hm3) y Valle Grande (168 hm3). El primero de ellos produce la recarga principal de la cuenca, que es del orden de los 130 hm3/aÃ±o en zona de acuÃ­fero libre. El aporte del rÃ­o Atuel, al ingresar a la cuenca es de escasa magnitud y en la mayorÃ­a de su recorrido se comporta como efluente captando aguas freÃ¡ticas y desagÃ¼es de la cuenca. Anualmente se realizan evaluaciones de riesgo de los mismos sobre dos hipÃ³tesis posibles, la ruptura simple y la ruptura en cascada, donde los volÃºmenes erogados variarÃ­an entre los 250 metros cÃºbicos y los 600 metros cÃºbicos, de acuerdo con las estimaciones de las empresas HINISA (HidroelÃ©ctrica Nihuil Sociedad AnÃ³nima) e HIDISA (HidroelÃ©ctrica Diamante Sociedad AnÃ³nima), concesionarias de los sistemas, la recurrencia de un posible incidente de menor gravedad se podrÃ­a presentar entre los 50/100 aÃ±os, mientras que no hay estimaciÃ³n posible para un incidente mayor. Otra de las variantes que presentan los eventos adversos con origen hÃ­drico, son los anegamientos de sectores bajos de nuestro departamento y que tienen como causa las lluvias estivales. Las mismas provocan el colapso de los sistemas de desagÃ¼e pluvial urbano y agrÃ­cola y ademÃ¡s el mal funcionamiento de los sistemas de tratamiento de aguas domiciliarios debiendo en algunos casos evacuar a las familias afectadas. Desde hace unas dÃ©cadas otro evento a considerar, aunque de progreso mÃ¡s lento que los anteriores pero de consecuencias importantes en la poblaciÃ³n regional, es el avance de la desertificaciÃ³n y las variaciones en su capacidad de contenciÃ³n de las napas de aguas subterrÃ¡neas.
