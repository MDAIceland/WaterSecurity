We have conducted two downscaling studies/impacts assessments with the University of Washington Climate Impacts Group and intent to conduct a third impacts assessment with the Climate Impacts Research Consortium in 2012 and 2013.  Our intent is to update our impacts assessments on a periodic basis as new information becomes available, such as new climate data generated for the IPCC assessment reports. Flexible Adaptation Pathways:SPU has used downscaled climate data to test the effectiveness of adaption options for offsetting the potential reductions in supply due to climate change.  SPU has emphasized low cost, intra system modifications and no regrets options that enhance the flexibility of the existing system rather than evaluating options that require major expansion and significant investments.Collaboration:SPU is an active leader in promoting collaboration on climate change within the water utility sector including the Water Utility Climate Alliance (WUCA), a group of 10 utilities in the US that provide drinking water to 43 million people.  WUCAâ€™s mission is to provide â€œleadership in assessing and adapting to the potential effects of climate change through collaborative action.   Engaging in Federal Climate Initiatives:SPU is active in federal climate initiatives.  SPU staff serve on the National Climate Assessment Development Advisory Committee, which is overseeing the development of the next US National Climate Assessment, and is serving as one of the Convening Lead Authors for the Water Resources Chapter.

These include Wentworth Park, Redfern Park, Redfern Oval, Pirrama Park, Harmony Park, Prince Alfred Park, Paddington Reservoir Gardens, Peace Park, Lillian Fowler Reserve and Coulson Street Reserve.Council has met its 2016 target for water usage in City parks of 180L per square metre of irrigated space. City parks and open spaces are currently trending at 171L per square meter of irrigated space. The 2012 Parks Water Saving Action Plan outlines nine action items that will contribute to achieving the Cityâ€™s sustainable water targets. These include staff training, new technologies and improvements to reporting.  The City has replaced the existing irrigation systems at Waterloo Oval, Edmund Resche Reserve and Pirrama Park. These upgrades will improve water efficiency and reliability of systems, and reduce the need for frequent maintenance often required by aging systems. Improvements to the data capture, via Cloudmaster, and record keeping are establishing a more reliable data set in which to evaluate and establish real water targets for high water use parks. On-going training and specifications that establish the Cityâ€™s targets are providing greater efficiency in water use. As new technologies and systems become available, the City will explore each option for future alternate water supply.","(-33.8675, 151.207)"

The NSW Government Flood Prone Land Policy assists in determining if development on floodplains is appropriate and sustainable.  The Floodplain Development Manual, developed by the NSW Government requires preparation of a Flood Study and a Floodplain Risk Management Study and development and implementation of a Floodplain Risk Management Plan.The City of Sydney local government area comprises eight drainage catchment areas in; Alexandra Canal, Blackwattle Bay, Centennial Park, City area, Darling Harbour, Johnstonâ€™s Creek, Rushcutters Bay and Woolloomooloo.The City has committed $1.8 million to city-wide Floodplain Risk Management Studies, which includes $600,000 in NSW and Federal Government grants. We have allocated $57 million for Green Square essential infrastructure drainage improvements, and $59 million over the next 10 years for drainage capacity works across Sydney.As part of our floodplain management approach, the City is undertaking the first ever city-wide look at the drainage issues and flood risks that exist in Sydney.  The work being undertaken includes a series of surveys of catchment areas.  These surveys will help us understand where drainage and mitigation works are required to ensure water flow and drainage is properly managed across the local government area.  This will dramatically reduce flood risk and safeguard local homes and businesses. The first Management Plan to be approved by Council is the Green Square West Kensington (GSWK) Floodplain Risk Management Study and Plan. This catchment is one of the lowest lying areas of our city, and subject to water ponding and flooding. The GSWK Plan proposes the creation of a large underground drainage culvert running 2.3 kilometres through the Green Square town centre from Link Road in Zetland to the Alexandra Canal. The culvert will drain floodwaters away from homes, businesses and roads in and around Joynton Avenue, Lachlan Street, South Dowling Street and Botany Road.","(-33.8675, 151.207)"

We have been taking a multi-pronged approach to promote water conservation using both hardware and software measures.We have been promoting water conservation to users in domestic and non-domestic sectors through a number of vehicles, such as Water Supplies Departmentâ€™s (WSD) Water Resources Education Centre, the â€œCherish Water Campusâ€ Integrated Education Programme, best practice guidelines for major water-consuming trades including the catering and hotel industries. We have also been installing flow controller installation programme at public rental housing estates, schools and government buildings. Further to the phased implementation of the Voluntary Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (WELS) since 2009, which covers showers for bathing, water taps, washing machines, urinal equipment and flow controllers, we launched the requirement of mandatory use of designated products registered under WELS for all new and existing buildings under major renovation in February 2017. Water Loss Management Having achieved significant reduction in water mains leakage through the 15-year replacement and rehabilitation programme for 3,000â€“kilometres (km) aged water mains, we are progressively establishing the Water Intelligent Network (WIN) to continuously monitor fresh water supply distribution network healthiness for timely and appropriate interventions to reduce water loss in the network.(Continue in next row)","(22.2881, 114.14)"

However, with challenges arising from climate change and increasing demand for the DJ water in neighbouring cities, we have been taking a responsible approach to diversify our supply sources and thereby enhancing our water security for the decades to come. Apart from expanding the salt water supply system, we have been exploiting alternative water resources less susceptible to climate change including seawater desalination, reclaimed water, grey water reuse and rainwater harvesting.Being a coastal city, Hong Kong has abundant seawater resources. Taking advantage of this and of the advancement in the related technology, we will develop a medium-sized seawater desalination plant using reverse osmosis technology at Tseung Kwan O. The first stage of the desalination plant will have a water production capacity of 135 000 cubic metres per day whilst the ultimate stage will increase the capacity to 270 000 cubic metres per day, equivalent to about 5% and 10% respectively of the overall fresh water demand in Hong Kong.We plan to supply reclaimed water to the north-eastern part of the New Territories in phases starting from Sheung Shui and Fanling. A preliminary financial and legal framework for the supply of reclaimed water in Hong Kong has been formulated, and the infrastructure works related to the supply of reclaimed water in various stages of design and construction area in progress.In addition, we have developed technical specifications and water quality standard for greywater reuse and rainwater harvesting for non-potable uses.

The R&R Programme was substantially completed in 2015. At present, the total length of water mains in Hong Kong is about 8 000 km.   Following the substantial completion of the R&R Programme, the condition of the water distribution network has been largely improved. The annual number of water main bursts has been reduced from the peak of about 2 500 in 2000 to 88 in 2017. The leakage rate has also been reduced from exceeding 25% in 2000 to about 15.2% in 2017. The water network would be managed under risk based asset management.Water Intelligent Network (WIN)Notwithstanding the completion of the R&R Programme, the water mains previously not covered in the R&R Programme will continue to age and deteriorate. Riding on the technological advancement of sensors, telemetry, network management software and data analysis in recent years, we consider it an opportune time to implement the Water Intelligent Network (WIN) to maintain the healthiness of the water distribution network. The essence of WIN is continuous monitoring of network performance in a holistic manner by utilising advanced technologies. Implementation of WIN enables the effective execution of measures under the four pillars of network management in an integrated and coordinated manner. These four pillars include (a) active leakage detection and control through the usage of the monitoring and sensing equipment installed in the network; (b) pressure management to reduce the pressure in the network of the PMAs; (c) quality and speedy repairs to water main leaks and bursts; and (d) asset management by reprovisioning of aged water mains which are beyond economic repair. WIN also enables detection of probable unauthorised consumption from the network.","(22.2881, 114.14)"

43928,Canberra,Canberra,Australia,Southeast Asia and Oceania,public,,2018,Increased water stress or scarcity,Diversifying water supply (including new sources),"The ACT has mitigated short to medium-term water supply security risks by recently completing two major construction projects: 1. Construction of an enlarged Cotter Dam, completed in October 2013 at a cost of AUD$410m, has increased the ACTâ€™s water storage capacity by 35%; and 2. Construction of the Murrumbidgee to Googong Water Transfer Pipeline, completed in September 2012 at a cost of AUD$140m. The ACTâ€™s long term water security is managed through day-to-day permanent water conservation measures to ensure supply through extended dry periods. The utility established these water conservation measures by basing modelling on 2030 climate change impacts. Prior to water conservation measures, Canberraâ€™s annual water consumption averaged between 60-65 GL. Since water conservation measures were put in place, overall water consumption figures dropped to 47.8 GL during 2012-13, and 47.1 GL during 2014-15 representing a 27% saving in per capita demand relative to 1993-2002 levels. In very extended dry periods, when storage levels are low, water can be pumped from two pump stations located on the upper Murrumbidgee River. For even more protracted dry periods, when the riverâ€™s natural flows are low, extra water can be sourced through water trading and through the arranged releases from Snowy Hydro Limitedâ€™s Tantangara Reservoir as part of a portfolio of water rights already acquired. Building supply system resilience is a risk management measure. In this context, resilience includes the following: 1. a diverse range of independent water sources and demand management measures; such as accessing more reliable water catchments or less rainfall dependant sources, or implementing a range of unrelated but concurrent demand management measures. 2. system interconnectivity to take advantage of any excesses in the system; such as gridding of water sources (the Cotter Googong Bulk Water Transfer is one example of interconnectivity already in place) 3. planning flexibility; allowing implementation of the responses best suited to actual emerging futures. There is an expectation that parallel severe drought contingency plans will be prepared. Drought contingency plans comprise more short-term emergency response plans that will ensure that basic water needs for a community can be met for the duration of a very severe drought.","(-35.3075, 149.124)"

According to best practice we have adopted a risk based approach using criticality and condition assessments and failure mode analysis rather than age to prioritise what assets are to be renewed first. Prioritising replacement of critical assets reduces consequences of failure for the community, reserving money to pay for emergency renewals as they occur in less critical pipes. We then see less critical assets run to failure, achieving maximum life and value for money. Service disruption is limited to the repair of less critical assets at the time of failure. We have also grouped renewals geographically to maximise opportunities for procurement efficiencies and to minimise disruption to the community.Over the next 30 years our Infrastructure Strategy outlines the following investments to improve the resilience of our network:â€¢ More inspections and preventative maintenance.â€¢More back-up spare parts for critical equipment.â€¢Increase the number of backflow protection units on high risk properties.â€¢Enhanced scenario based planning and mitigation for weather events.â€¢Investigate options for improving the resilience of water sources.â€¢Upgrade our critical pipe bridges.â€¢Upgrade our three water supply and 30 wastewater pump stations to be more reliable.â€¢Design back up options for parts of our water supply network that only have one pipe.","(-39.1011, 174.354)"

An ordinance on the protection of the groundwater catchment zone for the capital area from 1997 was an important step towards protecting the drinking water of the residents of the capital; the ordinance aimed among other things to ensure maximum quality of drinking water in the capital area for the future by preventing undesirable effects caused by any activity, trade or business on the water protection areas and their catchment area. In 2010 the ordinance was revised and a new ordinance issued in 2015 that sets stricter rules on land use and activities. A new and improved definition map of the water protection areas was issued the same year as a part of the Regional Plan for The Capital Area. The Public Health Authority is responsible for implementing the ordinance. Public Health Inspectors monitor the areas every year and take action if something is not in compliance with the ordinance. Regular monitoring of the water level shows that it has never gone below the criterion in the last decade. The reservoirs are under strict quality control, enforced by Veitur in compliance with their monitoring systems and by the Public Health Authorities in ReykjavÃ­k and neighbouring communities.

The EWMP Plan provides a blueprint for how to best manage urban runoff to provide for cleaner watersheds through regional collaboration. It describes a compliance pathway that Los Angeles County Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permittees in the watershed will utilize to fulfill requirements contained in the 2012 MS4 Permit.Culver City is implementing the EWMP through a series projects. The Culver Boulevard Stormwater Median Project is a subsurface retention and filtration project.  Currently in the design phase, it consists of an underground storm water containment structure below the existing raised median that will divert storm water and run-off from approximately 300 + acres of drainage area north of Culver Blvd. The storm water and urban run-off will be collected and retained to irrigate the landscape above. In the future, it may be used to irrigate Veterans and Lindberg Parks. Excess storm water and urban run-off will be filtered to a level in compliance with TMDLâ€™s and discharged back to the storm drain system downstream of the project. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.Another project that is in the design phase is the Washington Boulevard Stormwater Diversion Project which is part of the Marina del Rey EMWP Plan. This project proposes to divert and capture storm water and urban runoff from approximately 42 acres of drainage area that currently drains to Marina Del Rey Harbor. The project will be an underground system that diverts the run-off to the sanitary sewer system to be conveyed to City of Los Angelesâ€™ Hyperion Treatment Plant for treatment. Construction is anticipated to begin in May 2019.As part of EWMP implementation, the City will also be developing a Green Streets Masterplan that will develop future storm water projects citywide. Green streets is a component of the â€œcomplete streetsâ€ design goal.   In addition to storm water management, benefits include pedestrian safety and traffic calming, street tree canopy and heat island effect mitigation, increasing property values and even reduced crime rates.","(34.02, -118.4)"

The Low Impact Development (LID) Ordinance requires developers who build new projects to investigate measures that will reduce storm water runoff. LID encompasses distributed structural practices that capture, infiltrate, store and use, and/or treat runoff at the parcel. Common LID practices include bio retention, permeable pavement, and other infiltration BMPs that prevent runoff from leaving a parcel. Since the vast majority (nearly 70 percent) of runoff from the developed portion of the watershed is generated from impervious areas on parcels, LID is a natural choice as a key strategy to treat runoff from the parcel-based impervious areas. LID can be viewed as the ""first line of defense"" due to the fact that the water is treated on-site before it runs off from the parcel and travels downstream.","(34.02, -118.4)"

IDPH inspectors audit the laboratory every two years.  The audit consists of an onsite evaluation in which procedures, records, and equipment are inspected.  Over 200 different criteria must be met in order to be in perfect compliance with Zero Deviations.  Evanston's water quality lab has received the highest score of Zero Deviations five times in a row (most recent inspection in April 2015).  A membrane filter technique is used to test the water for the presence of total coliform using EC broth verification. Testing is done daily of both the raw (untreated) and finished (treated) waters.  In addition, over 80 tests are conducted on water samples collected from the Evanston distribution system each month.  Evanston also performs the bacteriological analysis of water samples collected from the Village of Skokie and submits the results to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency for compliance with Safe Drinking Water Regulations.  In total, Evanston's water quality lab performs over 37,000 individual tests on water samples throughout the year, an average of over 100 tests per day.The Water Quality Laboratory is also certified by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) for the monitoring of pH and fluoride.
